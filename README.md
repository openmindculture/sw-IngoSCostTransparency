# sw-IngoSCostTransparency

Inspired by potential customers' requirements and based on my [Shopware 6 Theme Plugin Development Template](https://github.com/openmindculture/IngoSDev6CertPrep), IngoSCostTransparency is a free and open-source extension for Shopware 6 that adds optional additional product details as custom fields with responsive and accessible graphic percentage display on the product details. Colors default to theme colors but can be modified by overwriting custom CSS properties. Default cost factor names are provided in English and German. Custom names can be set in the theme configuration.
